# Create-Silent-Office-365-Group
The purpose of this script is to create M365 groups, without the associated Sharepoint sites, hide from users Outlook client and block the welcome email that is usually sent.

Note: Once the group is created it has its primary email as the onmicrosoft address. Once the group propogates to Exchange it changes to the primary domain for the tenant.
